Roadmap
=======

I've recently tagged 0.1 in the repo. Below are the various aspects I will be
looking to cover during this release and the coming 0.2 tag.

DAML 0.1 series
---------------

* Start using DAML live at the dasa.cc domain to uncover problems
* Refactor current code base to create Parser instances.
* Rewrite/refactor sandboxed evals to to maintain namespace specific to
  transformation at-hand while still being reasonably fast.
* Try to uncover any and all issues related to characters in source document
  that will cause the parser to error
* Implement basic feature sets such as embedded html that will not be escaped
  if written in the source document and also declaring python variables
  containing html as safe. Any other basic features that arise during use.
* Debate whether or not to change attribute syntax to reflect css selector
  syntax more closely, specifically #header[attr=val][attr2=val2] or a
  variation of such.
* Possibly need to choose a new name? daml.org extends xml. This is a fuzzy
  line of sorts.

DAML 0.2 series
---------------

* Implement more complex features such as embedded daml syntax under for loops
  and if statements. Any other complex feature set that comes up. Test and
  debug throughout feature set.
* Setup basic cherrypy Tool for getting cherrypy users easily started.

DAML 0.3 series
---------------

* Work on django integration and implementing various features django provides
  into DAML so that, if one chooses, they can use this instead of built-in
  django templates, while not losing functionality.
