Features CSS selectors and indention for declaring page layout. Embed
python in your documents such as functions, lambda's, variable declarations,
for loops, list comprehensions, etc, writing it just as you would normally.
Filters that are linked to python function calls. First use of this is a
Django-style "block" and "extends". Will be easy to write custom filters and functions.
Still under heavy development, lots of bugs. Parses your documents extremely fast!
