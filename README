This project is a work in progress. Refer to dmsl/test/templates/ for additional syntax not covered here.

Building
========

dmsl depends on Cython >= 0.13 and lxml so install as per your distribution, for example

.. sourcecode:: bash
  
  #> sudo apt-get install python-lxml; sudo apt-get install cython

or

.. sourcecode:: bash
  
  #> sudo easy_install lxml; sudo apt-get install cython

or as I typically do

.. sourcecode:: bash
  
  #> sudo apt-get install python-lxml; sudo easy_install cython

After satisfying lxml and cython dependancy, build and install globally with the following

.. sourcecode:: bash
  
  #> sudo python setup.py install

or if you wish to not install globally, you can build the C extensions in place
and use from directory

.. sourcecode:: bash
  
  #> python setup.py build_ext -i

Running
=======
To run unit tests, build in place and execute:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  #> python test/

To use:

.. sourcecode:: python

  import dmsl
  dmsl.set_template_dir('./templates')
  dmsl.Template('index.daml').render({'content': 'Hello World'})
