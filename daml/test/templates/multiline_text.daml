        %h1 Example of Multiline Text
        %p This paragraph will stretch across
            multiple lines and all of the line breaks
            are indented under the parent.

            .embedded This div is embedded in the paragraph
                and also features multiline text in the
                source document.

            This text tails the %div.embedded and just as well,
            features multiline text that is aligned appropriately
            to the previous.

        %p It's worth noting that
            
            %em new tags
            
            need to be on a new line for now but more then likely
            this will probably
            
            %strong remain the same
            
            to keep source documents easy to read.

        %em#footer And there you have it.
